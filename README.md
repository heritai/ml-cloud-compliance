# 🛡️ AWS AI/ML Compliance Checker (Coming Soon)

This project is an **automated compliance checking tool** for AI/ML pipelines deployed in AWS cloud environments. It aims to assist engineers, researchers, and auditors in assessing the **regulatory alignment** of cloud-based machine learning workflows, with a particular focus on **GDPR compliance**.

---

## ✅ Key Features (Planned)

- 🔍 **Data Residency Check**: Detect if training/inference data is stored outside compliant regions.
- 🧪 **Model Explainability Assessment**: Evaluate use of interpretable models and SHAP integration.
- ⚖️ **Model Bias Assessment**: Evaluate any bias and fairness issues in the model.
- 📜 **GDPR Mapping**: Link compliance issues to specific GDPR articles with actionable suggestions.
- 📦 **S3 and SageMaker Integration**: Automatically inspect model artifacts, input data, and logs.
- 📈 **Markdown Reports**: Generate clean, audit-ready compliance summaries.
